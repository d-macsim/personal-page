## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Astro 5 + Tailwind CSS v4 + Motion v12 + Cloudflare Pages
- Architecture: Single-page with anchor navigation, content in TypeScript data files
- Design system must be defined in Phase 1 before any component work begins
- Animations deferred to Phase 5 — after layout is stable
- PDF download via /public/ with `<a download>` — no server logic needed
- [Phase 01]: Tailwind v4 via @tailwindcss/vite Vite plugin (not deprecated @astrojs/tailwind)
- [Phase 01]: CSS-only config via @theme block (no tailwind.config.js)
- [Phase 01]: Inter Variable font via @fontsource-variable (not Astro Fonts API)
- [Phase 01]: ThemeToggle as pure Astro component (no React needed)
- [Phase 01]: FOUC prevention via is:inline script in Head
- [Phase 01]: Static file analysis tests (not DOM-based) for design system verification
